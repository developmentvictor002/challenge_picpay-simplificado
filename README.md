## 📍What is it ?
This is my solution to the Simplified PicPay challenge. I decided to solve it to practice concepts I've been studying, such as standardized error responses with ProblemDetails, relationships between entities, docker, and the logical reasoning applied to the solution.
I tried to follow good practices for developing APIs with Java and Spring, such as layered architecture, use of DTOs, validation and conversion to entity in DTO, as I believe that it is the best way to do conversion, instead of using Mappers that break encapsulation.
